                If we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious or imminent threat to an individual’s life, health or safety or to lessen or prevent a threat to public health or safety;

                In the event we propose to disclose such personal information other than for the reasons set out in this policy, we will first notify you or seek your consent prior to such disclosure.

                <p>ALLIANCYS may at times use and disclose personal information about an individual for the “primary purpose” of collection (i.e. the dominant or fundamental purpose for which that information is collected).

                    As well as abovementioned purposes, that “primary purpose” includes facilitating our internal business processes, communicating with clients, prospective clients and other external parties, providing ongoing marketing information about our products and services, complying with our legal obligations and dealing with enquiries and complaints.
                    
                    In certain circumstances, the law may permit or require us to use or disclose personal information for other purposes (for instance where a client would reasonably expect us to and the purpose is related to the purpose of collection).
                    
                    Sensitive information
                    
                    Sensitive information is a subset of personal information.  It means information or opinion about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political organization, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual orientation or practices, criminal record, health information about an individual, genetic information, biometric information that is to be used for the purpose of automated biometric verification or biometric identification or biometric templates.
                    
                    Our policy is that we attempt not to collect sensitive information about our clients or prospective clients, however that may not always be possible. If any of our clients or prospective clients elects to provide us with any sensitive personal information, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the sensitive information is securely protected.
                    
                    In the event we propose to use such personal information other than for the reasons set out in this policy, we will first notify you or seek your consent prior to such use.

            <div class="sub">
                <h1>How we use your personal information</h1>
                <p>Once we collect your personal information, we will either hold it securely and store it on infrastructure owned or controlled by us or with a third-party service provider who have taken reasonable steps to ensure they comply with the AVG/GDPR Privacy Act.

                    ALLIANCYS will take all reasonable steps to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information under its control, and that the information it holds is accurate, complete and up to date including through appropriate physical and electronic security strategies.
                    
                    Only authorized ALLIANCYS personnel are provided access to personal information, and these employees are required to treat this information as confidential. We may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. However, when we consider information is no longer needed, we will destroy or permanently de-identify these records.
                    
                    Our policy is that all electronic records are only stored within Europe whenever this is commercially feasible. However, on occasion, a limited number of specialist software applications may involve the storage of personal data at an overseas location where a suitable alternative is not available. We presently disclose some information to the jurisdictions in Section 6 of this policy in limited circumstances.
                    
                    ALLIANCYS will only store data with an external provider if a technical assessment of a service provider’s security protocols is considered to meet or exceed the level of security that ALLIANCYS could apply if the electronic data were to be stored in ALLIANCYS’s own in-house systems and where we are satisfied that ALLIANCYS is able to meet its commitments under Dutch Privacy Legislation.

As the accuracy of personal information largely depends on the information that you provide to us, we request that you advise us of any errors in or updates require to your personal information.

                <p>Under the Dutch Privacy Principles, you have the right to request access to any personal information that we may hold about you and to advise us if the information should be corrected. The Dutch Privacy Principles set out the circumstances when we can refuse those requests. If we do refuse your request, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons (unless it would be unreasonable to provide them to you).

                    Subject to our right to refuse access, ALLIANCYS will provide you with a report that lists any personal information that we may hold about you.
                    
                    Our policy is to provide written acknowledgement of our receipt of any request for access to personal information or a request for correction of personal information within 7 days of the request being received. We will then provide a written response within 30 days of our receipt of the request.
                    
                    If you would prefer to submit a privacy request using a pseudonym or otherwise keep your identity secret, ALLIANCYS will do its best to support that request if it is feasible to do so under the circumstances.
